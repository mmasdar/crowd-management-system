![Tampilan Dashboard](desain_dashboard.png)

The Realtime Crowd Management and Monitoring System is an innovative solution designed to enhance safety and efficiency in crowd management, particularly in high-density areas like Masjidil Haram. This system leverages the power of deep learning to analyze real-time data from hundreds of CCTV cameras, providing actionable insights for effective crowd control.

## Key Features

- Real-Time Density Maps: Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques to generate density maps from live CCTV footage. This provides a clear visual representation of crowd distribution and movement patterns.
- Data Integration: Seamless integration of data from hundreds of CCTV cameras, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and analysis.
- Intelligent Suggestions for Crowd Management: The system not only monitors crowd density but also suggests management strategies based on the density map, time, and identified patterns.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The core programming language used for developing the system.
- Deep Learning: Employing deep learning models for accurate and efficient analysis of video data.
- Data Processing and Analysis: Techniques to handle and analyze large volumes of real-time data for generating insights.

## Visualization

The system includes a dynamic visualization component (image in PNG format), which illustrates the density maps and patterns derived from the CCTV data.

## Purpose and Impact

This project aims to revolutionize crowd management by providing a real-time, data-driven approach. It is particularly crucial for managing large crowds in sensitive and high-traffic areas, ensuring safety and smooth operation.
